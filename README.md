Master's thesis in mathematics on knot theory

Title: Some topics in knot theory

Author: Apoorv Potnis

Note: The proof of Proposition 5 (Bachelors' unknotting) on p. 4 is wrong. The statement and the idea of the proof are however correct. The constructed isotopy is problematic and the proof that this isotopy is continuous is not correct, as the isotopy is not linear in any variable.
