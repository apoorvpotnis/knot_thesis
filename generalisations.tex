\chapter{The Jones polynomial and its Generalisations}

% In the previous chapters, we defined Kauffman's bracket polynomial using the state model and then normalised it to get a link invariant. Instead of using the state model, one can define the bracket polynomial in an axiomatic way as well. One defines the polynomial as a function on link diagrams which satisfies certain properties. We would need to check the well-definedness and invariance of such a function under the Reidemeister moves. We thus define the bracket polynomial in the following way.
%
% \begin{defn}[Kauffman's bracket polynomial]
% 	Let \(K\) an unoriented link diagram. Then the bracket \(\bk \in \Z[A, A^{-1}]\) is defined by the rules:
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 		\item \(\braket<\hspace{-0.5pt}\KPA> = 1\).
% 		\item \(\braket<\KPA \cup K> = (-A^2 - A^{-2}) \braket<K\hspace{1pt}>\).
% 		\item \(\BB = A\BD + A^{-1}\BE\).
% 	\end{enumerate}
% \end{defn}
%
% This definition is consistent with the state model. \(\bk\) is invariant under the type II and type III moves. In order to gain type I invariance, we normalise it by adding an orientation and multiplying \(\bk\) with \((-A^3)^{-w(K)}\).
%
% \subsection{Jones polynomial}
%
% We now give an axiomatic definition of the Jones polynomial.

G\BG
H\BH

% \begin{defn}[Jones polynomial]
% 	Let \(K\) be an oriented link diagram. Then the Jones polynomial \(\displaystyle \V(K) \in \Z\left[\sqrt{t}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\right]\) is defined by the rules:
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 	    \item \(\V\CL = 1\).
% 		\item \(\displaystyle \frac{1}{t}\V\CF - t\V\CG = \left(\sqrt t - \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\right)\V\CH\).
% 	\end{enumerate}
% \end{defn}
%
It can be verified that this defines an invariant.






\begin{thm}[Jones polynomial]
	The Jones polynomial \(\V(t, K)\) is defined as \[\V(t, K) \coloneq \operatorname{L}\left(\frac{1}{t^1/4}, K\right)\] for an oriented link \(K\).
\end{thm}

Here, \(\displaystyle t = \frac{1}{A^4}\). \(\V(t, K)\) is a Laurent polynomial in \(\sqrt{t}\); \(\displaystyle \V(K) \in \Z\left[\sqrt{t}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\right]\). With the above definition, we have the following two properties of the Jones polynomial.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \(\V\left(t, \KPL\right) = 1\).
	\item \(\displaystyle \frac{1}{t}\V\left(t, \KPF\right) - t \V\left(t, \KPG \right) = \left(\sqrt{t} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\right)\V\CH\).
\end{enumerate}

We can define the Jones polynomial axiomatically as a Laurent polynomial in \(\sqrt{t}\) satisfying the above two properties as well. But then we would have to check well-definedness and invariance under the Reidemeister moves. We derive these properties using the definition. The first property follows evaluating the bracket polynomial on the trivial knot. Orientation of a knot does not matter in this case.

\begin{proof}[Proof of the second property]
	We know that \[\left\langle\KPB\right\rangle = A \left\langle\KPD\right\rangle + B \left\langle\KPE\right\rangle\] and \[\left\langle\KPC\right\rangle = B \left\langle\KPD\right\rangle + A \left\langle\KPE\right\rangle.\] Hence, \[B^{-1}\BB - A^{-1}\BC = \left(\frac{A}{B} - \frac{B}{A}\right)\BE.\] Thus, \[A\BG - A^{-1}\BF = (A^2 - A^{-2})\BH.\]

	Let \(w = \w\CH\) so that \(\w\CG = w - 1\) and \(\w\CF = w + 1\).
\end{proof}
